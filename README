Cheap Spherebot


The Cheap Spherebot is a based of a clone of the Original EggBot.  Initial design for the cheap eggbot was borrowed heavily from "Revised Fully Printable Eggbot" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20398 by Glasswalker on Thingiverse.

This project is divided into two parts, The parts required for building of the Cheap Spherebot, and the Arduino code to control it.  Everything here is still in very early development.
